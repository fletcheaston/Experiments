## Hi! I'm Fletcher Easton

I'm a Senior Software Engineer located in San Diego, CA.

I care deeply about code quality, maintainability, and doing things well.

When I'm not at the computer, you can find me at the gym, hiking the nearest mountain, or reading Sci-Fi.

If you want to get in touch, send me an email at [work@fletcheaston.com](mailto:work@fletcheaston.com).
