title: Advent of Code - 2022

Check out [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/)!

I've set my project up as a [FastAPI server](https://fletcheaston.com/advent-of-code/docs).
All endpoints have automated tests and some amount of documentation covering the problem.

I'm completing this in 2023, my stats are way off, but it's interesting to see how many people actually completed these challenges.
