Check out [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/)!

I've set my project up as a [FastAPI server](https://fletcheaston.com/advent-of-code/docs).
All endpoints have automated tests and some amount of documentation covering the problem.

I'm completing this in 2023, so I don't have the stats to post.
