title: Advent of Code - 2023
---

Check out [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/)!

I've set my project up as a [FastAPI server](https://fletcheaston.com/advent-of-code/docs).
All endpoints have automated tests and some amount of documentation covering the problem.

While I don't feel pressure to complete each challenge as fast as possible,
I'll keep track of times and ranking for each day here.
I'm on West Coast time (San Diego), so each challenge gets released at a pretty reasonable time (9pm).
